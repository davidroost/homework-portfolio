    <h1>Experience</h1>

    <p>I recently graduated from a Front-End Web Development course at General Assembly where I learned HTML,
      CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and how to be an awesome Front-End Web Developer! During my spare time, I enjoy
      senior water aerobics, pickling, and spending time with my goldfish, Jerry.
